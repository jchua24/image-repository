This app was made using create-react-app, and features a simple frontend UI that allows users to upload images to a gallery. The images are stored using Cloudinary, which also integrates nicely with the React UI and Node.js backend. If you'd like to try it out, you can access the project at this link: https://joshua-image-repository.herokuapp.com/. Additionally, below are a few screenshots of the application:
